        <p> St. Xavier's Collegiate School (informally SXCS) is a private Catholic primary and secondary school for boys, located in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. The school was founded in 1860 by the Jesuits under the supervision of Fr. Henri Depelchin S.J., and it is named after Francis Xavier, a 16th-century Jesuit missionary to India. The school caters to approximately 2,300 students.</p>


        <p1> the motto, Latin: Nihil ultra (translated as "nothing beyond"), along with the crest of the college date to the rectorship of Fr. O'Neill, S.J., 1904–1913.[3]

            The present imposing five-storied building was built from 1934 to 1940 at a cost of Rs 9 lakhs, which was collected partly from the public of Calcutta, assistance from Belgium, and the huge rental received from the American army that occupied the building during World War II.[1][4] Expansion of the school has been a long effort, with a campus slated for Salt Lake City, Kolkata and a second boys' hostel not far from the existing one.

            A commemorative stamp was issued by the Indian Post Office on 12 April 1985 depicting the campus and in its commentary recognising the school's contribution to society.[1] In 2019, the foundation stone was laid for a new kindergarten sectio</p1>
